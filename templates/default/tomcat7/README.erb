Hello, I am the '<%= @tomcat.name %>' instance of Tomcat '<%= @tomcat.major_version %>'.

We use CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE environment variables to clearly separate Tomcat installation from Tomcat instance configuration.
CATALINA_HOME is where your Tomcat server is installed: '<%= @tomcat.home %>'
CATALINA_BASE is where your instance of Tomcat is configured: '<%= @tomcat.base %>'
See <%= @tomcat.home %>/bin/catalina.sh

For more informations, read "Advanced Configuration - Multiple Tomcat Instances" chapter at http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/RUNNING.txt.

==================================================
Advanced Configuration - Multiple Tomcat Instances
==================================================

In many circumstances, it is desirable to have a single copy of a Tomcat
binary distribution shared among multiple users on the same server.  To make
this possible, you can set the CATALINA_BASE environment variable to the
directory that contains the files for your 'personal' Tomcat instance.

When running with a separate CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE, the files
and directories are split as following:

In CATALINA_BASE:

 * bin  - Only the following files:

           * setenv.sh (*nix) or setenv.bat (Windows),
           * tomcat-juli.jar

          The setenv scripts were described above. The tomcat-juli library
          is documented in the Logging chapter in the User Guide.

 * conf - Server configuration files (including server.xml)

 * lib  - Libraries and classes, as explained below

 * logs - Log and output files

 * webapps - Automatically loaded web applications

 * work - Temporary working directories for web applications

 * temp - Directory used by the JVM for temporary files (java.io.tmpdir)


In CATALINA_HOME:

 * bin  - Startup and shutdown scripts

          The following files will be used only if they are absent in
          CATALINA_BASE/bin:

          setenv.sh (*nix), setenv.bat (Windows), tomcat-juli.jar

 * lib  - Libraries and classes, as explained below

 * endorsed - Libraries that override standard "Endorsed Standards"
              libraries provided by JRE. See Classloading documentation
              in the User Guide for details.

              By default this "endorsed" directory is absent.

In the default configuration the JAR libraries and classes both in
CATALINA_BASE/lib and in CATALINA_HOME/lib will be added to the common
classpath, but the ones in CATALINA_BASE will be added first and thus will
be searched first.

The idea is that you may leave the standard Tomcat libraries in
CATALINA_HOME/lib and add other ones such as database drivers into
CATALINA_BASE/lib.

In general it is advised to never share libraries between web applications,
but put them into WEB-INF/lib directories inside the applications. See
Classloading documentation in the User Guide for details.

It might be useful to note that the values of CATALINA_HOME and
CATALINA_BASE can be referenced in the XML configuration files processed
by Tomcat as ${catalina.home} and ${catalina.base} respectively.
